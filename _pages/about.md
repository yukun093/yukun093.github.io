My name is Yukun Yu. Currently, I am a second-year master student at Aalto University, majoring in Mechanical Engineering, Mechatronics. I am energetic, optimistic, outgoing and eager to learn state-of-the-art technology in robotics. Although my major is mechanics, interests stimulate to learn more relevant technologies in the field of automation engineering.

Additionally, during my two-year studies, I was fortunately selected to be one of exchange student to be eligible to study at school of design and engineering, TUM. My interests are located in Robotics, and Mechatronics. Now, I am working on my master thesis at Robot Learning Group, Department of Automation and Electrical Engineering:

`dynamic motion planning to avoid collision with human for a mobile robot`

I have completed several projects spanning from Automation Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. More details should be found in blocks of projects

`AviGuardX, drone detection with neural network to avoid collision with plane`

`Development of one part of directed acyclic graph(DAG) at Computational Mechanics, TUM`

`Incursion of probability distribution of Road surface in the short & long term`

`Tissue type classification based on microarray gene expression profile`

`Using sqlalchemy and pandas to analyse weather data from Finnish Meteorological Institute`

`NCPC 2021 Competitive Programming`

`Projects in self-driving cars specialization including four projects simple control, state estimation and localization, motion planning`

`"Exops-m2" smart robot development and research project of joint angle calculation using Xsens`

`Tianwan Damaged Fuel Sealing Bottle Localization as an mechanical design program`

`ASME Nuclear Forensics at Shanghai Apollo Machinery Co., Ltd`

`Development of converter cooling system and gearbox cooling filtering system used in wind power products`

`Construction of a new wave simulation teaching experiment platform`

`Intelligent two-wheeled balance car`
