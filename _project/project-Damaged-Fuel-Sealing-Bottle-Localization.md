This was an nationalized project since the original drawings and products are purchased from russia. The cover image is cited from [here](https://www.cnnpn.cn/article/20860.html) and it is not the actual product but less thin and more finer than what is shown on the picture. During this project, what i was repsonsible for was to measure all the dimensions on the original product, draw the similar structure dependent on those dimensions and details detected by equipments, such as industrial endoscope, vernier caliper, etc. In the process of design the new structure and remove the some old ones, we also asked researchers from shanghai nuclear power engineering institute for helps to ensure the balance of heat dissipation. Another point we considered was that the new structure should cut down the irrelevant support such as keys and ribs to decrease the material cost and reduce the weight.
