It was one of another project when i was on the Apollo. It should be known that the cover image is cited from [here](https://www.ksb.com/zh-cn/yingyong/nengyuan-jishu/hedianzhan). Based on previous experiences, i was selected one of mechanical designers to participate in the ASME(American Society Mechanical Engineers) Nuclear Forensics. It was hold by six examiners, three from china and two from one another country(Korea) appointed by ASME.
During this process, we have experienced a series of trainings from design, material selection, material purchase, stress calculation and manufacturing equipment layout. Here a number of files i have written related to Spent Fuel Dry Storage Container listed as follows(no sequences):
