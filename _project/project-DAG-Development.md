This program is completed when I was an exchange student at Munich. It is put forward to practice skills of C++ basic programming, advanced git, design pattern or testing. The background is basically applied into the combination with physics to analyze the stress or choose the optimal path according to the numbers of nodes in the beam or rod. First, the Directed acyclic graph would be given, then use the smart point to share the node in the memory to find the suitable following nodes. Additionally, with a loop to iterate all nodes in the graph until the final node. After iteration of nodes, using MIT's testing frame to do tests for each function carefully and extensively.
