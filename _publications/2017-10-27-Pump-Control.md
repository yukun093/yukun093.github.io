This work is done when I was a third-year bachelor student in NingboTech, Zhejiang University. And I was fortunately that I was one of team members which is created by more than five people to discuss several topics related to hydraulic vibration researches.

It is the project supported by Zhejiang Natural Science Foundation, during the research, basically from the view of theory, we proposed two patents about hydraulic control system, relevant on how to improve the power and speed inside the pump control system.
